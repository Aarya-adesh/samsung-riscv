2-Bit Comparator using VSDSquadron Mini

Overview

This project involves implementing a 2-bit comparator circuit using the VSDSquadron Mini RISC-V development board. A 2-bit comparator compares two binary numbers (A[1:0] and B[1:0]) and outputs:

A > B (Green LED): Indicates that A is greater than B.
A == B (Yellow LED): Indicates that A is equal to B.
A < B (Red LED): Indicates that A is less than B.
This project showcases the practical application of digital logic and RISC-V GPIO programming using the PlatformIO IDE.

Components Required

VSDSquadron Mini Board.
4 Push Buttons (2 for A[1:0] and 2 for B[1:0]).
3 LEDs (Green, Yellow, Red).
Breadboard.
Jumper Wires.
VS Code and PlatformIO IDE.
Logical Diagram and Expressions

The comparator logic uses Boolean algebra to determine the three outputs:

A > B:
( G = A_1B_1' + (A_1 \cdot B_1)(A_0B_0') )

A == B:
( E = (A_1 \oplus B_1)' \cdot (A_0 \oplus B_0)' )

A < B:
( S = A_1'B_1 + (A_1 \cdot B_1)(A_0'B_0) )
